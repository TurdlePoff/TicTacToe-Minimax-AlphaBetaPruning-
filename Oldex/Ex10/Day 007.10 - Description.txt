Ex8 - Description

A program that tests char buffers with str functions

- BadBuffer is a bad buffer as there is no null termination 
	in the last item in the array
	- Null terminations are used for strings so that str 
		functions know where the string ends
- Greetings2 has the "Hello world" string which does not require 
	the null termination as it is inputted as a string

SizeOfValues
	BadBuffer  - 10
	Greetings1 - 12
	Greetings2 - 12
	
- Strcpy
	- Copies value of second array into the first array. 
		Reads up to null termination value.
	- strcpy(dest1a, Greetings1);
		- 8 values after the 12 values in Greetings1 will be raw 'ÃŒ' characters

- Strncpy
	- Copies value of second array into the first array.
		Copies the number of slots specified
	- strncpy(dest1c, Greetings1, 20);
		- 8 more values after the 12 values in Greetings1 will be \0
		
- Buffer Overun
	- Using strcpy with BadBuffer with the dest3[100] array will cause a buffer overun
		- This is because dest3 has a size of 100 slots
		- It overlaps with the memory else where that stores HELLO WORLD
	- Using strcpy with Greetings1 and dest4[5] will cause a buffer overun
		- This will happen as the size of dest4 has a size of 5 slots
		- The values within Greetings1 are too big for dest4
